## Anatomy of Instant App

A instant app is a Javascript object with following schema:

- `name`
- `description`
- `queryToData`: A function which takes a search query and converts into any data which could be displayed.
- `Component`: The React component of the app. The data from `queryToData` is passed as a prop.

See [apps/](apps).

## How do releases take place?

All the instant apps are published to npm registry [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@felvin-search/apps). Currently, we have an action setup which bumps up the package version, commits the tag and publishes the package.

These are minor releases i.e. `v0.3.0` -> `v0.4.0`

If there's a need for running the action manually, just go into the actions tab and click on the workflow to find the follow button:
